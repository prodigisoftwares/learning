# PR #3 Code Review - Create Exam Models

## Code Quality Improvements

### 1. Removed Redundant Pragma Comments

- Removed `# pragma: no cover` from `Exam.__str__()` and `TestBank.__str__()` methods
- These are already excluded via `.coveragerc` `exclude_lines` configuration
- Eliminates unnecessary inline comments

### 2. Fixed .gitignore Coverage Pattern

- Restored `.coverage*` pattern (was changed to `.coverage`)
- Ensures all coverage tool artifacts are properly ignored

## Summary

The exam models refactor is well-structured with proper separation of concerns (exam.py, flashcard.py, question.py). Models follow Django conventions with appropriate Meta classes, ordering, and related names. Admin registration is clean and uses decorator pattern correctly.

The `.coveragerc` configuration is now properly centralized, eliminating the need for inline pragma comments.

## Migration Note

Migrations will need to be run for the new models:

- Exam
- TestBank
- Question
- QuestionOption
- AcronymFlashcard
