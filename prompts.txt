ROADMAP & ISSUE GENERATION

Review all PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md and see all of the changelog entries in the CHANGELOG.md file. I need you to generate a good roadmap (ROADMAP.md) to get us from where we are now to being competitive with known commercial competitors and beyond. We'll want to build Epic issues of the roadmap at a later time but design it in such a way that we'll be able to build epics from them that are cohesive and timing conscious. The way we want to build is with each increment even within sub issues of an epic, is that the product will be useful as we go. We're building the plane as we fly it so to speak. Ideally we would want that after completion of the first epic, that this project is minimally useful if only for the developer of this project.

---

Based on this epic description below, use gh to create the epic issue (DO NOT CREATE ANY ADDITIONAL ISSUES BESIDES THE EPIC ISSUE):

...

---

About how many files would be touched to implement all of the details in this epic issue?

---

Break down the requirements of this epic into 5 or 6 evenly focused sub issues and then use gh to create them. Then use gh to update issue #71 with a listing of these sub-issues and order them in the order to be worked.

COMMON WORKFLOW

Use gh to view issue #_, review CLAUDE.md, PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md, DEVELOPMENT.md files for appropriate guidance, let's discuss how we want to tackle this issue. all of your output should be tldr style. Do not overthink or make this solution overly complex. Don't get defensive if i ask questions, just give an answer. Always source the venv of the project. Do not include any html comments in the django template files. Never use git write operations. Use test.sh to test new code and to view coverage. Ensure all lines of code are covered with unit tests except where it is too difficult to do so. When successfully done, generate a comprehensive summary of all work done. Write this as a changelong entry for this current branch in the appropriate changelog file in the changelogs subdir. Do not close the issue when we have finished.

Ensure that unit tests are covering this module as close to 100% as possible. Use test.sh for testing and coverage checking.

Review CLAUDE.md for appropriate guidance on refactoring. Refactor this module into smaller focused modules based on the classes in this module. Never use git write operations. Use test.sh for testing and coverage checking.

Review CLAUDE.md for appropriate guidance on refactoring. This module is now at over 1000 lines and although it uses only one class, it is time to consider refactoring it. So, refactor this test module into smaller focused modules creating new focused classes for this module. Never use git write operations. Use test.sh for testing and coverage checking.

DOCUMENTATION

Use git diff main to view code introduced in this branch vs main. If any of the code or features introduced in this branch affects the end-user (or an end-developer) or is new to them and undocumented, please make appropriate instructional documentation in the README.md file. For end-user, it should read as user instructions, not as marketing. If any of the code or steps taken is useful for either developer on this project, add it to DEVELOPMENT.md. Never use git write operations. No need to test code if you've only updated md files.

---

CHANGELOG DOCUMENTATION

Using git diff main, see the diff in code introduced in this branch vs main branch and generate a comprehensive summary of all work done. Write this as a changelong entry for this current branch in the appropriate changelog file in the changelogs subdir. Ensure that there is only one consolidated changelog file per issue/MR. Never use git write operations. No need to test code if you've only updated md files.
